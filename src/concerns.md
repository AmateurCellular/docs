## Concerns

Several people have brought up concerns about this project, whether
various aspects of legality or bandwidth used.

I'd like to settle these concerns as best as I can. Feel free to bring up
any and all concerns - we are interested only in operating in full compliance
with all regulations. 

Similarly we are good neighbors, for hams and non-hams alike. 

Interference is not our goal. Innovation is.

## Bandwidth

This is in the 900MHz and up microwave bands,
there's no risk of it being in the already very crowded VHF or other
bands simply due to practicality and hardware support. Not to mention
the fact that they are extremely crowded already. 

There's plenty of space in the 2.4GHz band for a 5MHz LTE signal without
even remotely stepping on expected band usage for voice, CW and typical
ham usage, and some hardware still exists that might be usable. 

As a general rule, if you don't have cell phones stepping on your ham
bands, our interests will not conflict with your usage of the bands.
And this isn't an issue for you because of the way different services
are separated to avoid interference.

This is only a possibility for us *because* there is existing hardware
that overlaps with some of our secondary privileges on the higher
frequency bands, whether due to differences in band plans across various
nations or because the cellular industry is spectrum hungry and looking
to expand across all spectrum possible.

## Legality

#### Encryption
See [encryption.md](encryption.md) for details, but to summarize -
we have this covered by publishing keys or otherwise removing the
confidentiality part of LTE, bringing us in compliance with the regulations.

#### Commercial interest
Amateur usage generally prohibits commercial usage.

We're doing this to experiment and build at the current level of
technology, while peeling back the commercial veil of understanding
around this technology.

It will not be replacing your consumer cell plan.

For one thing, it's never going to have wide coverage. The money that
goes into real cellular infrastructure is mind boggling.

#### Out of band operations
See [licenses.md](licenses.md). We are only interested in various ways
of legally experimenting with cellular technologies, but especially with
a focus on ham radio usage. 

## Summary
We are contorting ourselves to be legal and friendly, please assume
good faith and help us cover all our bases!
