This is a work in progress, keep us in mind.

## Why
See [rationale.md](./rationale.md)  in this directory. It's short!

## How

There are several concerns.

The first is the complexity of modern cellular systems - for this reason,
getting started with CBRS or similar is recommended to gain a fuller understanding of what's involved.

The second is all of the ham radio requirements.
