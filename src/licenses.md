## Amateur
We are all about the ham radio here, which offers the most flexibility of all on certain axes.

You may also be interested in other options.

## CBRS
Mostly license-free for low power. Probably the easiest way to come to grips with LTE stuff.

## STA
Not really a license, but a permission slip. This may be one way to get
temporary operating authority on bands that are not currently used in
your area. We should search to find existing applications.

## Lab
With everything turned to low power and through attenuators, or in a
nice metal box, you may be able to test without a license. This is often fairly hard to do well.

## non-RF
srsran supports zmq, meaning it simulates the RF side and does not actually require hardware at all.
