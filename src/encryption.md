## Part 97 encryption


Part 97 is very straightforward, and we have room for
experimentation. The interpretation of other hams is the largest problem,
the very word encryption strikes terror in the heart of the average
ham for some reason. 

The exact phrasing that is understood to prohibit encryption is in
`97.113a4` and `97.309b`:

> 97.113a4 (salient only)[Prohibited: ] messages encoded for the purpose
> of obscuring their meaning, except as otherwise provided herein;

and

> 97.309b RTTY and data emissions using unspecified digital codes must
> not be transmitted for the purpose of obscuring the meaning of any
> communication.

If we publish the protocol specification, we fall under 97.309a4, and
are therefore a specified digital code and the second phrasing does not
apply. This doesn't change anything, it was redundant. 

Either
way all we have to do is not be encoding for the purpose of obscuring
meaning. That is *really easy* to meet. 

But, there's also a cultural view to this - hams want to hear what's going
on, and being approachable and accessibly is good for experimentation
too. 

Whatever we do should comply not just with the letter of the regulation,
but the spirit of ham radio experimentation, and that's where publishing
keys or making available pcaps of clear traffic, or both, can help.

There are good arguments for why real encryption without published keys
might be perfectly legal.  If you are interested in those, I've made a habit of keeping this
link ready for the encryption topic:

But ultimately any way we have to make sure the encryption is not intended
to obscure meaning is sufficient per the regulation. Publishing keys is
the easiest and clearest step. Plaintext pcaps might be better in their
accessibility - keys are not all that useful to the average listener.



Ideas for doing this:
* Publish keys online as part of the specification and/or a public database like dmrid.
* Send CW or RTTY or similarly well-understood mode periodically and adjacent to the LTE channel with keys and project details, to stay within the commonly understood spirit of amateur radio too. That could also be a way to cover *some* identification requirements.
* Make pcaps of plaintext traffic available for some period of time.
